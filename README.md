# Hello_World
##Testing out repositories

Hi my name is Julie and I work at Victoria University
This readme file is very basic at the moment

I'm including some basic markdown commands
*this is italics*  and **this will be bold**
Lists are 
* apples
* oranges
  * navel
  * valencia

Here is an image of a kitty that I loaded up to images folder

Here is a link to the various markdown commands https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
  
I'm wondering if my colleagues can contribute to this document via github?
